# PowerButtonCounter

PowerButtonCounter is a counter that can be operated with the power button on your phone. The counter is triggered by switching the screen on and then off (press power button twice when screen is off). The service that monitors the screen state is started when the app is started. It can be stopped via the stop button.

The app is quite shitty. It just works.
